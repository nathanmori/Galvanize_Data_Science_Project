### Business Understanding
Talentful seeks to identify ideal candidates to meet client hiring needs. Social media profiles are a great way to gain information on potential recommendations.

The information available on social media varies from site to site. Identifying which profiles belong to the same user across sites allows us to combine the information available on each and to build complete candidate profiles.

An obvious step is to pair profiles that have similar first and last names. With a name-similarity filter, many potential matches remain for each profile. The goal of this project is to develop a model that sorts out matches and non-matches among the name-similarity pairs with an accuracy of 85% or higher.
